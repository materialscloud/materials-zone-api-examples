# MaterialsZone API Examples

This repository contains a collection of self-contained examples demonstrating how to use the [MaterialsZone REST API](https://developer.materials.zone) to interact with various elements of the platform, such as tables, protocols, parameters, items, and measurements.

Each example resides in its own subfolder under the `examples/` directory and includes its own README, code, sample input files, and dependencies. These examples are intended to help developers get started quickly and adapt the code to their own needs.

## 📚 Examples

### 1. `quantum_dot_example`

**Description:**  
This example walks through a complete flow for uploading materials and experiments related to quantum dots. It includes defining protocols, uploading composition data, processing parameters, and measurement files (emission spectra). It also performs a simple analysis on measurement files and writes the results back to the experiment table.

**Key Concepts Covered:**
- API usage
- Table, protocol and parameter creation
- Item creation and updates
- Measurement parsing and upload
- Emission spectrum analysis

More examples will be added over time to cover different use cases and data types.
